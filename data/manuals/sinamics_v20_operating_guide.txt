------------------------------------------------------------------------

SECTION 3: ELECTRICAL CONNECTIONS

Input Power Connections (Terminals L1, L2, L3 / L, N):
  - Wire Size: Per local electrical code, minimum as specified in technical data
  - Protection: Upstream circuit breaker or fuses as per NEC/IEC requirements
  - DO NOT connect power to output terminals (U, V, W) — this will destroy the drive

Motor Connections (Terminals U, V, W):
  - Connect motor phases in correct order for desired rotation direction
  - Maximum motor cable length: 50m unshielded / 25m shielded (without output filter)
  - For longer cables: Install an output reactor or sinusoidal filter
  - Shield connection: Connect cable shield to PE bar at both drive and motor end

Control Connections:
  - Digital Inputs (DI1–DI4): 24VDC, programmable function
    - DI1: ON/OFF1 (default)
    - DI2: Reverse (default)
    - DI3: External fault (default)

GROUNDING: The drive MUST be connected to protective earth (PE). Use the dedicated
PE terminal. Cable lug must ensure good metal-to-metal contact. Ground impedance < 10Ω.

SECTION 4: COMMISSIONING WITH BOP

Quick Commissioning Procedure:
  1. Power up the drive — display shows "P0010" after initialization
  2. Set p0010 = 1 (Quick commissioning mode)
  3. Enter motor nameplate data:
     - p0100: Motor region (0 = Europe/50Hz, 1 = North America/60Hz)
     - p0304: Rated motor voltage (e.g., 400V)
     - p0305: Rated motor current (e.g., 8.5A)
     - p0307: Rated motor power (e.g., 4.0 kW)
     - p0308: Rated motor power factor (cos φ, e.g., 0.82)
     - p0310: Rated motor frequency (e.g., 50 Hz)
     - p0311: Rated motor speed (e.g., 1450 rpm)
  4. Select application macro:
     - p0015 = 0: Factory default (DI + analog)
     - p0015 = 1: USS on BOP link
     - p0015 = 12: MODBUS RTU
  5. Set motor identification: p1900 = 1 (standstill measurement, recommended)
  6. Confirm with p3900 = 1 (End of quick commissioning)
  7. Motor identification runs automatically — motor may briefly energize

BOP Navigation:
  - Arrow Up/Down: Navigate parameters or change values
  - "P" button (short press): Enter/confirm parameter
  - "P" button (long press): Toggle between parameter number and value
  - "Fn" button: Access frequently-used parameter list

------------------------------------------------------------------------

SECTION 5: APPLICATION MACROS

The V20 provides pre-configured I/O setups called Application Macros:

Macro Cn000 (Factory Default):
  - Command source: Digital inputs (DI1 = Start, DI2 = Reverse)
  - Speed setpoint: Analog input AI1 (0–10V)
  - Most common setup for basic applications

Macro Cn001 (BOP Control):
  - Command and setpoint from BOP panel
  - Useful for commissioning and testing

Macro Cn002 (Fixed Speeds):
  - DI1 = ON/OFF, DI2 = Fixed speed 1, DI3 = Fixed speed 2, DI4 = Fixed speed 3
  - Configure fixed frequencies: p1001 (speed 1), p1002 (speed 2), p1003 (speed 3)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

SECTION 6: OPERATING MODES AND SPEED CONTROL

V/f Control (Linear):
  - Standard mode for most applications
  - V/f characteristic defined by p0304, p0310, and p1310 (boost voltage)
  - Suitable for: Conveyors, simple pumps, fans

V/f Control (Quadratic):
  - Set p1300 = 2
  - Reduced voltage at low speeds — saves energy on fan/pump loads
  - Suitable for: Centrifugal pumps, fans, blowers

V/f Control (FCC — Flux Current Control):
  - Set p1300 = 6
  - Improved dynamic response without encoder
  - Higher efficiency than standard V/f at partial loads
  - Suitable for: Applications requiring better speed stability

Energy Saving Mode:
  - Activated via p1312 = 1
  - Automatically reduces motor voltage at partial load
  - Typical savings: 10–30% on pump/fan applications operating below 75% load
  - Not recommended for constant torque applications

Speed Limits:
  - Minimum speed: p1080 (default 0 Hz, set to avoid motor resonance if needed)
  - Maximum speed: p1082 (default 50/60 Hz, can be increased for high-speed applications)
  - Skip frequencies: p1091/p1092 (define frequency bands to avoid mechanical resonance)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

SECTION 7: PROTECTIVE FUNCTIONS AND SAFETY

Built-in Protections:
  - Overcurrent (F30001): Instantaneous trip if output > 200% rated
  - DC link overvoltage (F30002): Trip on regeneration or mains overvoltage
  - DC link undervoltage (F30003): Trip on mains loss or brownout
  - Overtemperature (F30004): Heat sink temperature protection
  - Motor overload (I²t): Software thermal model protects motor
  - Ground fault detection: Monitors for earth faults on output
  - Phase loss: Input and output phase monitoring

Safe Torque Off (STO):
  - Integrated STO function conforming to SIL 2 (IEC 62061) / PL d (ISO 13849)
  - Terminals: STO1+/STO1-, STO2+/STO2-
  - Removes drive pulses — motor coasts to stop
  - Does NOT provide electrical isolation — do not use for maintenance lockout
  - Must be tested at regular intervals per machine safety assessment

IMPORTANT: STO prevents motor torque generation but does not disconnect mains power.
For energy isolation during maintenance, use an upstream disconnector with lockout/tagout.

SECTION 8: MAINTENANCE AND INSPECTION

Routine Inspection Schedule:

Weekly:
  - Check for unusual noise or vibration from the drive
  - Verify BOP display shows no active alarms
  - Check ambient temperature around the drive

Monthly:
  - Clean air intake and exhaust areas
  - Check for dust accumulation on heat sink fins
  - Verify cooling fan operation (should spin freely, no grinding noise)

Quarterly:
  - Inspect all power and control cable connections — retorque if necessary
  - Check for condensation or moisture inside the cabinet
  - Review fault history buffer (r2110/r2111) for recurring issues

Annually:
  - Perform motor insulation resistance test (megger test)
  - Thermal imaging of all power connections under load
  - Check DC link capacitor health via voltage ripple measurement
  - Verify protective functions (STO test, overcurrent test)

Fan Replacement:
  - Expected fan life: 3–5 years (depending on ambient conditions)
  - Symptoms of failing fan: increased heat sink temperature, grinding noise
  - FSA/FSB: Fan not field-replaceable (replace entire drive)
  - FSC/FSD/FSE: Fan is field-replaceable. Order part number from Siemens catalog.

DC Link Capacitor Aging:
  - Capacitors degrade over time, especially at high temperatures
  - Expected life: 5–10 years at rated conditions
  - Symptoms: Increased DC link voltage ripple, frequent F30002/F30003 faults
  - Measurement: Compare Vdc ripple at no-load against commissioning baseline
  - If ripple increased > 50%, replace the power module
