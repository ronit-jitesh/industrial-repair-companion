SECTION 1: OVERVIEW OF FAULT AND ALARM SYSTEM

The SINAMICS G120 uses a structured diagnostic system:
- Faults (Fxxxxx): Drive trips and motor stops. Must be acknowledged after root cause is resolved.
- Alarms (Axxxxx): Warning conditions. Drive continues to operate but condition should be investigated.

Fault acknowledgment methods:
1. Toggle Digital Input (DI) configured for fault acknowledge
2. Via BOP (Basic Operator Panel): press the "Reset" button
3. Via fieldbus (e.g., PROFINET command word bit 7)
4. Power cycle (OFF1/OFF2) for latched faults

SECTION 2: POWER UNIT FAULTS (F300xx)

F30001 — Power Unit: Overcurrent
  Description: The output current has exceeded the maximum permissible value.
  Probable Causes:
    - Short circuit in motor cable or motor windings
    - Earth/ground fault on output
    - Motor parameters (p0304, p0305, p0307) incorrectly set
    - Sudden load impact exceeding drive capacity
  Remedies:
    1. Check motor cable for damage and correct connection
    2. Perform insulation test on motor (disconnect from drive first)
    3. Verify motor nameplate data matches parameter settings
    4. Run motor identification (p1900 = 1 or 2)
    5. If load impact is cause, consider increasing drive rating
  Related Parameters: p0304 (Rated Voltage), p0305 (Rated Current), p0307 (Rated Power)

F30002 — Power Unit: DC Link Overvoltage
  Description: The DC link voltage (r0026) has exceeded the maximum permissible threshold.
    - 400V units: Trip at approx. 810 VDC (normal operating ~565 VDC)
    - 200V units: Trip at approx. 405 VDC (normal operating ~283 VDC)
  Probable Causes:
    - Motor regenerating energy during deceleration (most common)
    - Line supply voltage too high
    - Deceleration ramp time (p1121) too short for load inertia
    - Braking resistor not connected or faulty
    - DC link voltage controller (Vdc) deactivated
    - Interrupted line phase
  Remedies:
    1. Increase ramp-down time p1121 (try doubling the current value)
    2. Set ramp smoothing times p1130/p1136 to relieve Vdc controller
    3. Activate DC link voltage controller: set p1240 = 1
    4. Check mains voltage against p0210 setting
    5. If load has high inertia, install a braking resistor (p1237, p1238)
    6. Verify braking resistor connection and resistance value
    7. Check for interrupted supply phase — all 3 phases must be present
  Related Parameters: r0026 (DC link voltage), p1121 (Ramp-down time), p1240 (Vdc controller)
  SAFETY WARNING: DC link capacitors retain dangerous voltage after power-off.
    Wait at least 5 minutes before opening the unit.

    1. Perform factory reset (p0970 = 1)
    2. Re-commission the drive with correct parameters
    3. If fault recurs, replace the Control Unit (CU)

F30021 — Power Unit: Ground Fault
  Description: An earth/ground fault has been detected on the motor output.
  Probable Causes:
    - Damaged motor cable insulation
    - Motor winding insulation failure (moisture, age, overheating)
    - Cable glands not properly sealed (moisture ingress)
    - Long motor cable without output filter
  Remedies:
    1. Disconnect motor cable from drive, measure insulation resistance
    2. Inspect cable routing — avoid running next to high-voltage lines
    3. Check motor for moisture damage, dry out if necessary
    4. For cables > 50m, install an output reactor or dU/dt filter

SECTION 5: GENERAL TROUBLESHOOTING PROCEDURES

Step-by-Step Diagnostic Procedure:
  1. Read the fault code from the BOP display or via diagnostic buffer (r0945)
  2. Note the fault value (r0949) — this provides additional context
  3. Check the operating conditions at time of fault:
     - DC link voltage (r0026)
     - Output current (r0027)
     - Motor speed (r0021)
     - Heat sink temperature (r0037)
  4. Cross-reference with the fault description in this document
  5. Check for environmental factors:
     - Ambient temperature (should be < 40°C without derating)
     - Humidity (non-condensing)
     - Altitude (derate above 1000m)
     - Vibration level (max 0.5g per IEC 60721)
  6. Implement the remedy and clear the fault
  7. Monitor for recurrence — if fault returns, escalate to next remedy level

Preventive Maintenance Schedule:
  - Monthly: Clean air filters, check fan operation
  - Quarterly: Inspect cable connections, check for unusual vibration or noise
  - Annually: Insulation test on motor, thermal scan of connections
  - Every 5 years: Replace cooling fan, inspect DC link capacitors (ESR measurement)

SAFETY NOTICE: All work on the drive must be performed by qualified personnel.
Disconnect power and wait 5 minutes before accessing internal components.
Follow local electrical codes and Siemens safety instructions at all times.
