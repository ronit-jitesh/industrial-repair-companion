SECTION 1: SAFETY PRECAUTIONS

DANGER: Variable frequency drives contain hazardous voltages that persist after
power is removed. DC link capacitors may retain lethal voltage (up to 800 VDC)
for several minutes after power disconnection.

Mandatory Safety Procedures Before Any Work:
  1. Disconnect and lock out the main power supply
  2. Wait minimum 5 minutes for DC link capacitors to discharge
  3. Verify absence of voltage with a rated voltmeter:
     - Measure between L1-L2, L2-L3, L1-L3 (input)
     - Measure between U-V, V-W, U-W (output)
     - Measure between DC+ and DC- terminals
  4. Apply personal protective equipment (PPE):
     - Safety glasses with side shields
     - Insulated gloves rated for the voltage class
     - Arc flash protection per NFPA 70E / local equivalent
  5. Install safety barriers and warning signs

Live Work (Diagnostic Only):
  - Permitted only by qualified personnel with arc flash risk assessment
  - Required PPE as determined by arc flash study
  - Use insulated test instruments rated CAT III minimum
  - Keep one hand in pocket when making measurements near live parts
  - Never work alone on energized equipment

Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) Protection:
  - Control boards contain ESD-sensitive components
  - Use ESD wrist strap grounded to the drive frame before handling boards
  - Transport replacement boards in anti-static packaging only

------------------------------------------------------------------------

SECTION 2: PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE

2.1 Daily Checks (Operator Responsibility)
  - Visual check of drive status LEDs (no red fault LEDs)
  - Listen for abnormal sounds (grinding, clicking, buzzing)
  - Check no alarm messages on operator panel
  - Verify motor is running smoothly at expected speed

2.2 Monthly Maintenance
  Checklist:
  □ Clean air intake filter (or replace if damaged)
  □ Check cooling fan operation:
    - Fan should spin freely without resistance
    - No grinding or rattling noise
    - Air flow test: Hold tissue near exhaust — should deflect strongly
  □ Inspect drive exterior for:
    - Dust accumulation (clean with low-pressure dry air, max 2 bar)
    - Signs of moisture or condensation
    - Pest ingress (insects, rodents)
  □ Check ambient temperature at drive location
    - Record reading - should be < 40°C
    - If > 40°C, investigate cabinet cooling system
  □ Review fault log for recurring alarms or warnings

2.3 Quarterly Maintenance
  Checklist:
  □ Retorque all power cable connections:
    - Input terminals (L1, L2, L3): Torque per drive manual
    - Output terminals (U, V, W): Torque per drive manual
    - PE ground terminal: Torque per drive manual
    - Loose connections cause overheating → premature failure
  □ Inspect control wiring:
    - Check for chafing, discoloration, or brittleness
    - Verify terminal screws are tight
  □ Check for vibration at drive mounting:
    - Mounting screws tight
    - No visible cracks in mounting bracket or panel
  □ Inspect DC bus connections (if accessible without energized work):
    - Look for discoloration indicating overheating
    - Check bus bar torque per specifications
  □ Run motor at various speeds and check for:
    - Unusual vibration at specific frequencies (resonance)
    - Current balance across phases (should be within 5%)
    - Speed stability (use tachometer to verify)

2.4 Semi-Annual Maintenance
  Checklist:
  □ Replace air filters (even if visually clean)
  □ Detailed thermal inspection under load:
    - Use IR camera to scan all connections
    - Flag any hotspot > 20°C above ambient
    - Compare with baseline thermogram from commissioning
  □ Motor insulation resistance test:
    - Disconnect motor cable from drive terminals
    - Use 500V megger for motors rated < 690V
    - Minimum acceptable value: 10 MΩ (new), 1 MΩ (in service)
    - If < 1 MΩ: Investigate cause (moisture, contamination, aging)
    - Record values for trend analysis
  □ Check motor bearing condition:
    - Vibration measurement: Overall velocity < 4.5 mm/s (ISO 10816 Class I)
    - Listen with stethoscope for bearing noise
    - Check bearing temperature: Should not exceed 80°C

2.5 Annual Maintenance
  Checklist:
  □ Replace cooling fan (if > 3 years old or showing signs of wear)
  □ DC link capacitor health assessment:
    - Measure DC link voltage ripple at no-load
    - Compare with factory commissioning baseline
    - Ripple increase > 30%: Plan replacement within next shutdown
    - Ripple increase > 50%: Replace immediately
  □ Firmware check: Compare installed firmware with latest available
    - DO NOT update firmware without testing in a non-production environment first
  □ Complete parameter backup:
    - Download all parameters to STARTER/SCOUT project file
    - Save to secure network location with date stamp
    - Verify backup by comparing key parameters with running drive

SECTION 3: CORRECTIVE MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES

3.1 Procedure: Cooling Fan Replacement
  Applicable: SINAMICS G120 (FSC and above), S120 Booksize
  Tools Required: Screwdriver (Phillips #2), replacement fan (order by frame size)
  Time: 15–30 minutes

  Steps:
  1. Power off and lock out the drive
  2. Wait 5 minutes for capacitor discharge
  3. Remove fan retaining clip or screws (location varies by frame size)
  4. Disconnect fan cable from PCB header connector
  5. Remove old fan — note orientation (airflow direction arrow)
  6. Install new fan in same orientation
  7. Reconnect fan cable — ensure firm connection
  8. Replace retaining clip or screws
  9. Power on and verify fan operation
  10. Monitor heat sink temperature for 30 minutes under load

3.2 Procedure: Motor Cable Insulation Failure Repair
  Applicable: All VFD systems
  Tools Required: Megger (500V), cable repair kit or replacement cable
  Time: 1–4 hours depending on cable length

  Steps:
  1. Isolate the drive: Power off, lock out, verify zero voltage
  2. Disconnect motor cable at drive and motor terminals
  3. Perform insulation resistance test phase-to-phase and phase-to-ground
  4. Identify the failing phase or section
  5. If damage is localized:
     - Cut out damaged section, install cable joint (rated for VFD duty)
     - Ensure joint has proper shielding continuity
  6. If damage is extensive: Replace entire cable
     - Use VFD-rated cable (symmetrical shield, suitable for high dV/dt)
     - Route new cable per installation requirements
  7. Reconnect and repeat insulation test — must pass > 10 MΩ
  8. Perform brief test run and monitor output current for phase balance

3.3 Procedure: Responding to Repeated F30002 (DC Link Overvoltage)
  If F30002 recurs despite parameter adjustments:

  Investigation Steps:
  1. Record the following at time of each fault:
     - Fault value (r0949) — indicates measured DC link voltage at trip
     - Motor speed (r0021) — was motor decelerating?
     - Output current (r0027) — was current near rated?
     - Heat sink temp (r0037) — was unit thermally stressed?
  2. Check deceleration ramp time (p1121):
     - For high-inertia loads: Ramp time should be >> mechanical time constant
     - Quick test: Double the ramp time and observe if fault recurs
  3. Check mains supply voltage:
     - Measure with power quality analyzer for at least 24 hours
     - Look for voltage swells (>110% of nominal)
     - Check if solar panels or other generators are on the same bus
  4. If braking resistor is installed:
     - Measure resistor: Should be within ±10% of nameplate
     - Check for open circuit (most common failure mode)
     - Verify braking module is receiving DRIVE-CLiQ communication (S120)
  5. Check for mechanical issues:
     - Suddenly released load (coupling failure, belt break)
     - Process upset causing rapid speed reduction demand

SECTION 4: ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION MONITORING

Critical Environmental Parameters:

Ambient Temperature:
  - Optimal range: 5°C to 40°C
  - Below 0°C: LCD display may not function, warm-up period recommended
  - Above 40°C: Current derating applies (typically 2% per °C)
  - Above 50°C: Drive should not be operated — install cooling

Humidity:
  - Acceptable range: 5% to 95% non-condensing
  - Condensation risk: Occurs when drive surface temperature drops below dew point
  - Prevention: Install cabinet heater (anti-condensation heater) for equipment
    stored in unheated buildings or subject to large temperature swings
  - Detection: Check for moisture/water marks inside cabinet during inspections

Altitude:
  - Up to 1000m: No derating required
  - 1000–2000m: Derate current output by 1% per 100m above 1000m
  - Above 2000m: Contact Siemens for specific guidance
  - Reason: Reduced air density decreases cooling effectiveness

Vibration:
  - Maximum continuous vibration: 0.5g (IEC 60721-3-3, Class 3M4)
  - If drive is mounted on vibrating machinery: Use vibration dampeners
  - Check mounting bolts for loosening due to vibration (quarterly)

Contamination and Corrosive Gases:
  - Chemical environments: Use sealed NEMA 4X / IP66 enclosure
  - Conductive particles (metal dust): Use pressurized cabinet with filtered air
  - Salt spray (coastal locations): Conformal coating on PCBs recommended
  - Hydrogen sulfide (H₂S): Corrodes copper quickly — use sealed enclosure

------------------------------------------------------------------------

SECTION 6: FIELD CALIBRATION PROCEDURES

6.1 Analog Input Calibration (AI1)
  When the speed reference signal does not match commanded speed:
  1. Apply 0V (or 0mA) to AI1 and record parameter r0755 (scaled value)
  2. Apply 10V (or 20mA) to AI1 and record r0755
  3. If readings deviate from expected:
     - Adjust p0757 (minimum scaling) and p0758 (maximum scaling)
     - Verify with independent voltage/current measurement

6.2 Motor Parameter Identification
  After motor replacement or if motor performance seems degraded:
  1. Set p1900 = 1 (Standstill identification — motor does not rotate)
     - Drive measures stator resistance, leakage inductance, main inductance
     - Duration: 2–5 minutes depending on motor rating
  2. For best results, set p1900 = 2 (Rotating identification)
     - WARNING: Motor will rotate — ensure it is safe to do so
     - Measures full motor model including inertia
     - Required for high-performance servo applications

6.3 Speed Measurement Verification
  After encoder replacement or suspected encoder drift:
  1. Command motor to a known speed (e.g., 1500 rpm)
  2. Measure actual speed with handheld tachometer or strobe
  3. Compare with displayed speed r0021
  4. Acceptable deviation: < 0.1% for servo, < 1% for standard applications
  5. If deviation exceeds limits: Check p0408 (encoder PPR) configuration
